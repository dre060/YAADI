yaadi
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[yaadi](https://www.yaadiproject.org/yaadi-wallets/) is the original yaadi client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of yaadi transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from one to two hours. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run yaadi on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run in terminal:

- ./yaadi-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or ./yaadid (headless, 32-bit)
- ./yaadi-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or ./yaadid (headless, 64-bit)

### Windows

Run the installer, and then run yaadi-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag yaadi-Qt to your applications folder, and then run yaadi-Qt.
